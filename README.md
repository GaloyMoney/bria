## Key features
- multi account / multi wallet / multi queue
  - you can configure multiple wallets scoped to an account
  - signing via multiple supported remote signers including feeding PSBTs manually
  - transaction batching via configurable payout queues (check the demo for details)

- cloud ready - intended for use as part of a distributed system
  - designed to be horizontally scalable
  - support for idempotent operations via external IDs
  - embed and update external metadata on addresses and payouts to reference external data
  - globally ordered event sequence can be streamed to achieve guaranteed eventual consistency

- advanced accounting via an embedded ledger
  - internal use of double sided bookkeeping
  - database dump of ledger conforms with accounting best practices
  - great for accountants / auditors to know exactly what is going on

- secure by design
  - extensive automated testing (unit + integration in rust, end-to-end using BATS)
  - all sensitive credentials (like remote signer config) encrypted at rest to prevent db leaks comprimising funds

## Quickstart
### Build from source
* Download the source code
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/GaloyMoney/bria
  ```
* Make sure you have [Nix](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer) and ```Docker``` Installed
* Build
  ```
  cd bria
  direnv allow
  make build
  ```
* Add the location of the binary to the PATH
  ```
  PATH="${PATH}:$(pwd)/target/debug"
  ```
### [Demo Walkthrough](docs/demo.md)


## Developing with Nix Environment

To run commands in the [Nix](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer) environment, there are two primary methods:

1. **Using `direnv`:** If `direnv` is installed and hooked into your shell, simply `cd` into the repository. Nix will automatically bootstrap the environment for you using the flake. On the first run, you'll need to execute `direnv allow` to load the environment configuration.

2. **Manual Entry:** Alternatively, you can manually enter the environment by executing `nix develop`. You can also run a specific command directly with `nix develop --command <command>`, or use the environment as you prefer.

### Running Tests

- To run the tests, use the following command:
    ```bash
    make reset-deps next-watch
    ```

### End-to-End Tests

- For bash-based end-to-end tests, we use [bats](https://bats-core.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) as a test runner. To execute these tests, run:
    ```bash
    make e2e
    ```

### Local Daemon for E2E Tests and Exploration

- If your end-to-end tests stall, or if you simply wish to inspect the state or experiment locally, you can start the local daemon with:
    ```bash
    make local-daemon
    ```
- Once the daemon is up, you can run CLI commands against it. For example:
    ```bash
    cargo run --bin bria help
    ```
