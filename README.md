## Key features
- multi account / multi wallet / multi queue
    - you can configure multiple wallets scoped to an account
    - signing via multiple supported remote signers including feeding PSBTs manually
    - transaction batching via configurable payout queues (check the demo for details)

- cloud ready - intended for use as part of a distributed system
    - designed to be horizontally scalable
    - support for idempotent operations via external IDs
    - embed and update external metadata on addresses and payouts to reference external data
    - globally ordered event sequence can be streamed to achieve guaranteed eventual consistency

- advanced accounting via an embedded ledger
    - internal use of double sided bookkeeping
    - database dump of ledger conforms with accounting best practices
    - great for accountants / auditors to know exactly what is going on

- secure by design
  - extensive automated testing (unit + integration in rust, end-to-end using BATS)
  - all sensitive credentials (like remote signer config) encrypted at rest to prevent db leaks comprimising funds

## Installation
* Requirements on Debian / Ubuntu Linux
    ```
    # git, make, direnv
    sudo apt install git make direnv
    ```
* download the release binary from https://github.com/GaloyMoney/bria/releases
    ```
    version=0.1.40
    # on linux
    build=unknown-linux-musl # on MacOS use: build=apple-darwin

    wget https://github.com/GaloyMoney/bria/releases/download/${version}/bria-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl-${version}.tar.gz
    ```

* build from source
    ```
    # install the Rust toolchain
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    source "$HOME/.cargo/env"

    # download the source code
    git clone https://github.com/GaloyMoney/bria

    # build
    cd bria
    make build

    # add the location of the binary to the PATH
    PATH="${PATH}:$(pwd)/target/debug"
    ```

## Configuration
* Connect to dependencies as found as an example in the [docker-compose file](docker-compose.yml)
  - postgres - to store the internal state
  - bitcoind - to provide the chain state to the electrum server
  - fulcrum - a performant electrum server
  - bitcoind-signer - a potential signer
  - lnd - a potential signer
  - mempool - self-hostable backend used for fee estimations
  - otel-agent: optional for observability

* For testing start the preconfigured dependencies with docker
    ```
    docker compose up -d integration-deps
    ```
* provide the connection parameters as environment variables

    ```
    # create the .envrc file
    cat <<EOF > .envrc
    export PG_HOST=127.0.0.1
    export PG_CON=postgres://user:password@${PG_HOST}:5432/pg
    EOF

    direnv allow
    ```

## Usage

* provide a database encryption key
  ```
  export SIGNER_ENCRYPTION_KEY="0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
  ```

* start the bria daemon with the [default configuration](tests/e2e/bria.local.yml)
  ```
  bria daemon -c .tests/e2e/bria.local.yml run
  ```
* create an API key (stored in the .bria folder)
bria admin bootstrap

* list accounts
  ```
  bria admin list-accounts
  ```

For testing see the commands in the [helpers.bash file](tests/e2e/helpers.bash)


## Developing
For developing all dependencies are run via docker compose

* To run the tests make sure `PG_CON` is pointing to the PG instance inside docker:
  ```
  # create the .envrc file
  cat <<EOF > .envrc
  export PG_HOST=127.0.0.1
  export PG_CON=postgres://user:password@${PG_HOST}:5432/pg
  EOF

  direnv allow
  ```

* Add the dev dependencies
  ```
  make install-dev-deps
  ```

* Run the tests via
  ```
  make reset-deps next-watch
  ```

* For bash based e2e tests we use [bats](https://bats-core.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) as a test runner.
Run the tests via:
  ```
  make e2e
  ```

* If your e2e tests stall and you want to inspect the state (or just want to play around locally) then:
  ```
  make local-daemon
  ```
* Will bring up the daemon and you can run cli commands against it eg:
  ```
  cargo run --bin bria admin list-accounts
  ```
